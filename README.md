# Customer Segmentation using KMeans Clustering

This notebook demonstrates customer segmentation using the KMeans clustering algorithm on a mall customer dataset. The analysis focuses on grouping customers based on their annual income and spending score.

Key Steps
Data Loading & Exploration

Loaded the mall customer dataset (200 records, 5 features)

Checked basic statistics and data quality (no duplicates, no missing values)

Visual Analysis

Created visualizations to understand relationships between features (though not shown in the partial code)

Feature Selection

Selected "Annual Income (k$)" and "Spending Score (1-100)" as clustering features

KMeans Clustering

Implemented KMeans clustering

Used the elbow method and silhouette score to determine optimal clusters (k=5)

Cluster Analysis

Analyzed and interpreted the customer segments

Visualized the clusters (not shown in partial code)

Key Findings
The analysis identified 5 distinct customer segments based on spending behavior and income levels. This segmentation can help the mall tailor marketing strategies to different customer groups.
